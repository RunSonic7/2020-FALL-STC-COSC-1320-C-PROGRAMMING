   Name: Juan Mireles II
   Course: COSC 1320.V01 - C Programming
   Term: Fall 2020
   Institution: South Texas College
   Instructor: Mr. Joseph Perez
   Due: Sunday, September 27, 2020
   Notes: Develop a C program that will determine whether a department store 
          customer has exceeded the credit limit on a charge account. For each 
          customer, the following facts are available:

            Account number (4 digits)
            Balance at the beginning of the month
            Total of all items charges by this customer this month
            Total of all credits applied to this customer's account this month
            Allowed credit limit

          The program should input each fact, calculate the balance 
          (=balance + charges - credits), and determine whether the new balance 
          exceeds the customer's credit limit. For those customers whose credit 
          limit is exceeded, the program should display the customer's account 
          number, credit limit, new balance and the message "Credit limit exceeded."
