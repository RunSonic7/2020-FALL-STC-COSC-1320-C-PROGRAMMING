Test 1

Create a directory on the linux server called test1. You must place the test in
that directory and lose 5 points and I will organize the file in the appropriate
folder.

Write a program that will personally great you. (e.g. Welcome back agent Perez!)
After greeting you, the program should prompt you for 3 numbers representing,
the current date's month, day and year.

(e.g.
What month is it? (enter as a number): 8
What day is it? (enter as a number): 22
What year is it? (enter as a number): 2020

You will use those numbers to calculate YOUR real birthday and the program will 
display YOUR current age. The program will display your age and based on the age
the program calculated should display a response based on 3 possible conditions.

(e.g.

age below 18 display Spring C-hicken
age above 18 below 25 Young C-hicken
age above 25 Just a C-hicken)

The program should also wish you a Happy Birthday! or a Happy Unbirhtday!

You must turn in a flowchart or psuedocode for this test. The .c file should
reside on the linux server by the due date in order not to lose any points. The
flowchart or psuedocode should be uploaded to this assignment page.
