Final Exam
Place the final exam in a folder called final on the linux server.

The final exam looks very similar to Test 2 but I want you to use arrays this
time and to use the pointer notation to traverse the array within the functions.

Create a program that display a menu to the user. The choice should be as follows:

Enter 5 grade
Show average (with the 5 grades) and letter grade
Show highest grade
Show lowest grade
Exit

If you want to put the menu into a function you may. The program should use a
switch statement for using the appropriate function based on the user's choice.
Each option should be implemented int its own function (use appropriate names
for the functions). Initialize the variables for grades randomly between 50-100
so if the user selects show average as their first choice, there will be some
grades in the variables already.

You should have the following functions:  In ONE OF them you should traverse the
array using pointer notation.

Function 1: This function is responsible for getting the 5 grades at once and
placing them into the array.  Validate that the grades are in the range between
0-100 (use a loop). (use pointer notation to traverse the array)

Function 2: Calculate the average of the 5 grades passed in and display the
average with 1 decimal place and also display the letter grade.

Average	Letter Grade
90 - 100	A
80 - 89	B
70 - 79	C
60 - 69	D
Below 60	F


Function 3: Have this function receive the array as a parameter and returns the
highest grade to the main. The main will use that value to display it. Do not
display in this function. (use pointer notation to traverse the array)

Function 4: Have this function receive the array as a parameter and return the
lowest grade to the main. The main will use that value to display it. Do not
display the function. (use pointer notation to traverse the array)

Use a loop to repeat the entire program until the user hits 5 to exit.
